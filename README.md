THis project was a lot of fun! This was my second revision of a Asmebler because I ran into a lot of issues that would have been
fixed if I did a study of how Assemblers worked and this was the result of a lot of study.

I made a fully functional CPU(outside of programming some OP codes) out of logic gates using the logic gate simulator Logisim. 
I did a ton of self teaching on how CPUs worked and wanted to create my own. I used a simple ROM chip to store all the opcode and would turn on the required
signals to perform each machine coded command all I had left to do was complete the opcode programming. I did not save the CPU to a cloud storage so don't have it
anymore ufortunutly ,but this was a Assembler I was working on to both learn how actual Assemblers worked and to learn a bit of the C programming language. It does two
passes like a real Assembler does to covert everything into tokens and allows for lables to jump to other parts of the code. The second pass acrually converts the token
to machine code that would be then copy and pasted into the Ram chip to run a program written in ASM on my own CPU.

After my old computer died I abonded this project due to not having the CPU anymore.
